Sat 10 - 10:00 - Glibc Heap Analysis in Linux Systems with Radare2 (n4x0r)

Even though the functionality of the Heap is well known between Reverse
Engineers and Exploit Developers, generally the internal mechanisms of this
memory region are unknown due to the poor documentation and complexity of the
different dynamic memory allocators and their differences across systems. For
that reason, this talk is intended to familiarize the audience with the Linux
Heap structure formed by the glibc malloc dynamic memory allocator algorithm
along with its analysis using radare2.
