** why am I here in 3 steps **

1. A thing I own stopped working. I **wanted to know why**.
2. I inquired @trufae on radare's ARMv5 and AVR support.
3. Radare pullrequests [#5701 #5453 #5444 #5247 #5060](https://github.com/radare/radare2/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Abrainstorm) and [a few more issues](https://github.com/radare/radare2/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20author%3Abrainstorm%20). Impossible
without @trufae and community patience and attention.

Note:
I **DO NOT** think drones are specially cool toys.
I just like to solve interesting problems. 

Reversing == Awesome brain gymnastics.
