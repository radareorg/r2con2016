Fri 9 - 16:00 - GSoC/RSoC - argument detection/vartypes/radeco/webui (oddcoder + xvilka)

This is the third year the radare project is able to participate in a Summer Of Code competition, starting with a crowdfunding and finally this year we were able to get accepted by Google in the GSoC, which allows us to bring the oportunity to some students to learn more about C, reverse engineering and r2 itself thanks to our mentoring.

This talk will allow students to expose their work and experience, this is: better support for kernel stuff, enhanced material webui, radeco decompiler, variable analysis and type checking and ROP gadget classification.
