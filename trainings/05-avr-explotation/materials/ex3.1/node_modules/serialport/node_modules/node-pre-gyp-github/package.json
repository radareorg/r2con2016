  "readme": "# node-pre-gyp-github\n##### A node-pre-gyp module which provides the ability to publish to GitHub releases instead of Amazon S3 or some other cloud host.\n\n##Usage\nInstead of ```node-pre-gyp publish``` use **```node-pre-gyp-github publish```**\n\n## Install\n```javascript\nnpm install -g node-pre-gyp-github\n```\n\n## Configuration\nThis module is intented to be used with node-pre-gyp. Therefore, be sure to configure and install node-pre-gyp first. After having done that, within **```package.json```** update the ```binary``` property ```host``` so it matches the following format:\n\n```\nhttps://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/releases/download/{1.0.1}\n```\nBe sure to replace ```{owner}```, ```{repo}```, ```{1.0.1}``` with actual values.\n\n***WARNING: Variable substitutions are not supported on the ```host``` property so you will have to manually update the version number with every change.*** Failure to do so will result in users installing the wrong binary versions.\n\n**Tip:** Since the version number will be included within the ```host``` you can ommit it from the package name.\n\nWithin GitHub, create a new authorization:\n\n1. go to Settings \n2. click Personal access tokens\n3. click Generate new token\n4. Select all checkboxes (in a future update I will specify which precise checkboxes are needed, but for now...)\n5. Generate Token\n6. copy the key that's generated and set NODE_PRE_GYP_GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable to it. Within your command prompt:\n\n```\nSET NODE_PRE_GYP_GITHUB_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n```\n\n## Example\n1. node-pre-gyp configure\n2. node-pre-gyp build\n3. node-pre-gyp package\n4. node-pre-gyp-github publish\n",
